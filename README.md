# denisova

Files associated with data from Meyer et al paper on high-coverage
Denisovan genome. This repo contains no data; just the scripts we used
to download and filter the data and to convert it into .raf format for
use with Legofit.

Subdirectories, each with its own README.md file:

bed: contains .bed files used for quality control

orig: contains genome sequences and corresponding .raf file for the
original version of the Denisovan genome, as described by Meyer et al.

orig2: supersedes directory "orig". These data have been assembled
using Prufer's aDNA-aware program.
